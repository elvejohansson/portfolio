# Portfolio 🌍

My personal portfolio website, currently hosted on [Netlify](https://elvejohansson.dev).

## Why Netlify?
Just one reason: automatic CI.

Because it's, right now atleast, just a static HTML site, there is no need for fancy deployment or anything like that. Just point my domain towards Netlify and everytime I push to GitHub, end users will see the results right away and I don't have to do anything :).
