# Portfolio üåç

My personal portfolio website, currently hosted on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**.

## Why Vercel?
I currently host my website(s) on Vercel (Netlify in the past), as it's a good one-stop shop for domain + site management. It plays nicely with Next.js, which I like, and it has very fast build and deploy times, both for sites and SSL certifications + domains.

***So why did you move from Netlify?***
Netlify isn't bad and if it works for you, keep using it. I just think that Vercel has tighter integration with the web ecosystem as a whole. Who knows, maybe a new service will pop up which will be better (in my opinion) than both Netlify and Vercel, or Netlify will come out with new features that make me switch back. You never know :)
